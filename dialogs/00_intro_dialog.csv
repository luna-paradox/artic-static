E,serious, , , "Hello miss Torres, welcome to the DAP, the Deep Arctic Program"
E,serious, , , "I'm glad our training was fruitful, congratulations on getting the position"
C,smug, , , "Yeah, for a second I though you were going to kill me for real during training"
E,u_u, , , "You still need to work on your attitude"
C,smug, , , "I'm just funny like that"
C,smug, , , "So, what's the operation is ACTUALLY about? You said that after getting selected I was gonna get more information"
E,serious, , , "First, just emphasize that all talked here is extremely confidential. You know what happen to people who betray us"
C,smug, , , "I'm aware yeah, the higher ups are very fond of taking away your teeth I heard"
E,u_u, , , "That's just savage. They'll just kill you, there is no need for torture"
E,serious, , , "Anyways, we are about 5.500 meters under sea level right now, just under the Arctic"
E,serious, , , "This hole was discovered 23 years ago and it's been under our company control for 8"
E,serious, , , "We call it The Well"
E,serious, , , "It presents a number if anomalous phenomena in which we're VERY interested"
C,smug, , , "It seems like lately everything is anomalous"
E,serious, , , "What can I say? It's the new state of the world"
E,serious, , , "The main things you need to be aware are Temperature and Static"
E,serious, , , "The Well is on a constant -10Â°C but most of the water will not freeze for some reason, but is also very localized"
E,serious, , , "This is what give its form to the well and cave system connected to it"
E,serious, , , "But the most important part is the Primordial Oooze, colloquially known as Static"
E,serious, , , "It oozes from the walls of the well and its caves and it's even colder than the water"
E,serious, , , "Your objective is to retrieve this Static and come back alive, hopefully multiple times"
C,smug, , , "Hopefully?..."
E,serious, , , "Yeah, all the other pilots have died on action, but you should be aware of thi-"
C,smug, , , "Yeah I know, skill issue. I'm just hurt that you have such low confidence in me, I tried so hard to impress you!"
E,angry, , , "Don't get overconfident Torres, this is dangerous work"
E,serious, , , "I wouldn't want to see you die too..."
C,smug, , , "Ooooh, so you DO care about me?"
E,u_u, , , "I care about the mission"
C,smug, , , "Call me Camila, that's my name, I hate when people call me by my last name"
E,serious, , , "Sure, I don't really care"
C,smug, , , "So I can call you Emma? What about honey?"
E,serious, , , "No"
C,sad, , , "So cold"
C,smug, , , "What does this Static does anyways"
E,serious, , , "That's above your clearance, just know that is VERY important and that we can use it to upgrade your submarine"
E,serious, , , "It'll allow us to make it better that what normal physics allow us to"
C,smug, , , "I see, so that's what for"
E,u_u, , , "..."
E,serious, , , "Anyways! Start by using your radar to go to the cave at the west"
E,serious, , , "Remember that you can check the controls of your vessel at any moment"
E,serious, , , "..."
E,serious, , , "But really, don't die on me"
C,smug, , , "Hehehe, don't worry boss, I'll be back to have dinner with you"
E,serious, , , "I like to eat alone, bye"
